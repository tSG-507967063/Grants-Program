-the roadmap: https://cryptothought.wixsite.com/tsg-507967063/general-8

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
